<h3>Introduction</h3>

The power flow analysis, also known as load flow analysis, is essential for determining the steady-state operating conditions of a power system. It involves calculating the steady-state active (P) and reactive (Q) powers, voltage magnitude (V), and the angle (δ) of each bus of the system. In general, only two of them are known and other two remain unknown at a bus. Based on these steady-state known and unknown quantities, each bus in the power system are classified as load bus (or PQ bus), generator bus (or PV bus), and slack bus (or reference bus). The known and unknown quantities of these buses are listed below -<br>
