		{
			"question": "In context of FDPF method which statement is true? ",
			"answers": {
				"a": "In normal steady state operating conditions, the voltage magnitudes are approximately equal to 1.0.",
				"b": "The transmission lines are mostly reactive in nature, the conductances are very small as compared to the susceptance  Gᵢⱼ ≪ Bᵢⱼ .",
				"c": "For normal steady state operating conditions the angle difference between two buses is very small, i.e., δᵢ - δⱼ ≈ 0 (within 5°-10°). ",
				"d": "All of the above."
